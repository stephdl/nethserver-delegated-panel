==========
Delegation
==========

You can grant permissions for a user or a group to the server-manager.
Each module must be allowed, else you can delegate all panels.

If all panels are delegated, then the future panels (not yet installed) are also granted

You can give the sudo right to a user or a group. If no commands are given, 
then there is no sudo restriction.
