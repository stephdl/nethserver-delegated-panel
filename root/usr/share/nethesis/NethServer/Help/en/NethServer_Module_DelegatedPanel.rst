Delegation of authority
=======================

What is Sudo?
    Sudo (su "do") allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) 
    the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments. 

Keep in Mind the 3 rules of administrator
    1) Respect the privacy of others.
    2) Think before you type.
    3) With great power comes great responsibility.

Sudo privilege
    You can give the sudo privilege to a user or a group. If no commands are given,
    then there is no sudo restriction. You must give the correct path to the command.


Delegation of panel
    You can grant permissions for a user or a group to the server-manager.
    Each module must be allowed, else you can delegate all panels.

    If you use the radio button 'Delegate all panels', then the future panels (not yet installed) will be also granted
